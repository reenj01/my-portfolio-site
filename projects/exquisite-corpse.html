      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>An alien landed on a random deserted farm on Earth. The alien feels very out of place in this new planet and looks at the appearance of the scarecrow and thinks that is the normal way of how living beings on Earth dress. Therefore, it wears the patched and torn scarecrow shirt and incorporates the metal bars as its limbs. After dressing up, the alien walks inside the abandoned farmhouse and finds a doll with a cut off head. Taking an interest in the weirdly shaped legs, it takes the limbs of the doll and attaches it to its own leg. Finally, the alien has truly blended in with the beings of Earth. Or did it?</p>
