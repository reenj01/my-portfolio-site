      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>I think that I am unfortunately fast to anger. However, in anger, there are various different emotions that make up the emotion "anger." I feel anger in these stages. First, I feel either shocked, betrayed, or sad. Then I feel upset, disappointed, and depressed. Then it leads to annoyance, anger, and emptiness. No matter what situation I encounter, my emotion follows this similar path. However, these stages go by so quickly that I don't have time to recognize each emotion during that time; everything is chaotic. Therefore, I wanted to create an abstract work that illustrates a feeling of an constant illusionary pattern in a user affected chaos.</p>
